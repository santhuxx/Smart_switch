# Bluetooth-enabled Smart Switch with Touch Sensor

---

## Description
This project involves creating a Bluetooth-enabled smart switch with a touch sensor, powered by an Arduino Pro Mini and controlled via a custom app developed using MIT App Inventor. The smart switch allows effortless control of a room lamp, either through a touch sensor or remotely via Bluetooth.

## Features
- **Touch Sensor**: Instantly toggles the room bulb on/off with a simple touch, providing intuitive control.
- **Custom App**: Developed using MIT App Inventor, the app connects via Bluetooth for remote operation.
- **Arduino Pro Mini**: Handles programming logic and sensor interfacing, ensuring smooth operation of the touch sensor and relay control.

## Technologies Used
- **Arduino Pro Mini**: Microcontroller for sensor interfacing and control logic.
- **MIT App Inventor**: Platform for developing the custom Android app.
- **Bluetooth Module**: For wireless communication between the app and the Arduino.

## Learning Outcomes
- Integration of electronics with practical solutions for home automation.
- Development of a custom Android app using MIT App Inventor.
- Utilization of Arduino for sensor and relay control.
- Enhancement of problem-solving and programming skills.

  

## Installation
### Hardware Setup
1. Connect the touch sensor to the Arduino Pro Mini.
2. Connect the relay module to the Arduino Pro Mini.
3. Connect the bluetoothe module to the Arduino Pro Mini.
4. Pair the Bluetooth module with the Arduino.
5. Connect the Relay Module to the room lamp for controlling the bulb.
